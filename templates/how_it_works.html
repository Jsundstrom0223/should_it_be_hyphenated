                    You'll either receive an answer to your hyphenation question, or you'll be asked a quick question about your use of the compound.</p>

                        <li>The Chicago Manual of Style includes a hyphenation rule that's directly applicable to your search term</li>
                        <li>The compound is in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary as a hyphenated compound (e.g., "well-being"), a closed compound (e.g., "hardworking"), or an open compound (e.g., "close call")</li>
                       
                 
                        <p>Otherwise, the app will look up each part of your compound in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and ask you to pick the definition that most closely matches your use of the term. In that case, you’ll receive an answer after you’ve made your selections.</p>

                    <p>Should It Be Hyphenated? is a work in progress with a few minor limitations.</p>
                    <li>The app adheres to Chicago Manual of Style hyphenation standards and retrieves all definitions / spellings from Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, one of the dictionaries recommended by the manual. When the Chicago Manual and the dictionary disagree on the hyphenation of a term,
                    the app gives precedence to the manual.
                    </li>
                    <li>Currently, it does not support search terms with more than one hyphen; nor does it differentiate between compounds that use a hyphen and compounds that use an en dash.</li>
                    <li>It does not return information on <a href="https://dictionaryapi.com/products/json#term-ure:~:text=a%20sense.-,undefined%20entry%20word,-An%20undefined%20entry">undefined entry words</a> (i.e., words that are included in the dictionary without a definition or a link to another
                    term with a definition).</li>
                    <li>Should It Be Hyphenated? ignores the parts of speech listed below. If a dictionary entry's functional label (part of speech) field includes one of those parts of speech, the app will omit that entry from
                    the entry information it returns; however, it will still return the other entries for the search term.
