                <p>Once you've entered a compound that you think may be hyphenated, one of two things will happen: 
                You'll either receive an answer to your hyphenation question, or you'll be asked a quick question about your use of the compound.</p>
        
                <p>You'll receive an answer right away in the following cases:</p>   
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">The Chicago Manual of Style includes a hyphenation rule that's directly applicable to the compound you entered</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">The compound is in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary as a hyphenated compound (e.g., "well-being"), a closed compound (e.g., "hardworking"), or an open compound (e.g., "close call")</li>
                </ul>
                        
                <p>Otherwise, the app will look up each element of your compound in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and ask you to pick the definition that best matches your use of the term. In that case, you’ll receive an answer after you’ve made your selections.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">The app adheres to Chicago Manual of Style hyphenation standards and retrieves all definitions and spellings from Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, one of the dictionaries recommended by the manual. When the Chicago Manual and the dictionary disagree on the hyphenation of a term,
                    the app gives precedence to the manual.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Currently, it does not support search terms with more than one hyphen; nor does it differentiate between compounds that should use a hyphen and compounds that should use an en dash.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">It does not return information on entries for <a href="https://dictionaryapi.com/products/json#term-ure:~:text=a%20sense.-,undefined%20entry%20word,-An%20undefined%20entry">undefined entry words</a> (i.e., entries that do not include a definition or a link to another
                    entry with a definition).</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Should It Be Hyphenated? ignores the parts of speech listed below. If a dictionary entry's functional label (part of speech) field is set to one of those parts of speech, the app will not return information on that entry; however, it will still return the other entries for the search term.
