# Should It Be Hyphenated?

Should It Be Hyphenated? is a work-in-progress Flask app with a Python back end. The app relies on Merriam-Webster's CollegiateÂ® Dictionary with Audio API; specifically, it takes user input submitted through forms and then builds a request URL that includes that input. It then parses the JSON returned by the API. Should It Be Hyphenated? is hosted on Render [here](https://should-it-be-hyphenated-kmfc.onrender.com/).

For more information on Merriam-Webster's APIs, see the Merriam-Webster Developer Center's [FAQ page](https://dictionaryapi.com/info/frequently-asked-questions) or [JSON documentation](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/json).
