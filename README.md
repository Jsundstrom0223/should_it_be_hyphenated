# Should It Be Hyphenated?

Should It Be Hyphenated? is a work-in-progress Flask app with a Python back end. The app relies on the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary API; specifically, it takes user input submitted through forms and then builds a request URL that includes that input. It then parses the JSON returned by the API. Should It Be Hyphenated? is hosted on Render [here](https://should-it-be-hyphenated-kmfc.onrender.com/).
