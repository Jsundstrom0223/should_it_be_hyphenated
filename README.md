# Should It Be Hyphenated?

Should “ad hoc” be hyphenated?
What about “well lit”?
Is it “break-in” or “break in”?

The question of whether a compound should be hyphenated can be surprisingly tricky 
to answer. Hyphenation often depends on context and part of speech; some terms, for 
example, are hyphenated before but not after a noun. Others are hyphenated when used 
as nouns but not as verbs. In other cases, it may be best to forgo hyphenation (or 
to include it) to maintain consistency within a document. And Googling a hyphenation 
question may be more confusing than helpful, because different style guides and 
sources have different (and often contradictory) standards.

Should It Be Hyphenated?, created by a technical editor, aims to help answer those questions.

Should It Be Hyphenated? is a work-in-progress Flask app with a Python back end. The app relies on Merriam-Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary with Audio API and is hosted on Render [here](https://should-it-be-hyphenated-kmfc.onrender.com/).
